            I chose this website because I found it interesting, different, and unnecessarily unintuitive.

            <u>Usability Issues:</u>

        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>The norm is for menu bars to be at the top or left side of a page, so users may have to
                     look harder to find this menu bar at the bottom</li>
                <li>I intuitively want to scroll down on this page, maybe because the menu bar is on the
                     bottom, but scrolling just leads to the photo moving up a little bit then back down</li>
                <li>The large background photo that takes up the most of the page is too low quality for
                     its size—it looks pixelated and out of focus</li>
                <li>The big “FISHWIFE” text in the middle of the photo could be hard to read for some 
                    people—the font is not the most clear/legible and it is against a fully saturated photo</li>
                <li>The “Seafood・Restaurant・Bar” text under the “FISHWIFE” text in the middle of the photo 
                    do not match either of the other fonts on the page and has a gray border around the letters 
                    which makes the text look clickable (their location in the hierarchy of the page might also 
                    be contributing to the clickable aspect)</li>
                <li>The most common use of restaurant websites is to view the menu, which is not given any 
                    focus or emphasis on this webpage</li>
                <li>The “FISHWIFE” text at the bottom of the page breaks up the menu bar, unintuitively 
                    acts as a home-button, and is repetitive considering the exact same text directly above</li>
            </ul>

            <u>Usability with WebAIM WAVE:</u>
        </div>
        <div class="text">
            <ul>
                <li>Detected very low contrast between the “Seafood・Restaurant・Bar” text and the background 
                    colors</li>
                <li>The “FISHWIFE” text at the bottom of the page is a linked image without alternative text, 
                    which means that there is no information about the function of the link for a screen 
                    reader to provide for a user</li>
                <li>The language of the document (“lang” value in html) is unidentified/invalid, which 
                    prohibits translation and correct screen reading</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="text">
            <p>
                I agree with the issue of low contrast and although I didn’t think of the other two issues 
                because I have never used a screen reader or built a website with alternative text, I now know 
                that alternative text and language identification are very important and need to be added.
